The Legion didn't need more trouble, especially from a crew that had just tried to rip off the galaxy's tightest bank. And then there were the rumors. Talk around town was that the Jailbirds didn't leave the Red Bank empty-handed. They'd gotten their hands on somethin' big: access to a digital wallet loaded with $RED, straight from REDACTED, that fancy privacy project every crook in the system was whisperin' about. This wasn't just any score; it was the kind of access that could make a gangster's life a whole lot easier - concealed transactions, untraceable movements, deals done in the shadows without leavin' a single digital fingerprint. Like pullin' off a heist in broad daylight and vanishin' into thin air.",

The Luna Legion knew it and also the Jailbirds knew exactly what they were sittin' on. They weren't about to let that kind of control slip through their fingers without a fight.",

But the Jailbirds weren't just some scared punks hidin' anymore; they were makin' moves, pushin' back against the Legion's grip, and stirrin' up trouble like only they could. With the Assassins in their corner and flush with that $RED they had the resources to make the Hub their playground.",

Every time they paid off a shady dealer or bought a night's peace in one of the Hub's grimy hotels, more of those RED$ tokens spread into the hands of local gangsters. Suddenly, the IBC Gangsters, who were just mindin' their own, started gettin' a taste of this unexpected windfall. It was like Christmas came early, and everybody wanted a piece.",

Tensions are rising, alliances are cracking, and the city's ready to blow. You know the rules: nobody's safe, and the house always wins… unless someone's crazy enough to burn it down.",
