## Manifesto

Born in the gritty streets of Earth back in 2021, the IBC Gangsters were just faces in the crowd, grinding the 9-5, punching the clock, chasing that green while dreaming of a better life. Until one day, Mo Ron, a charismatic slick talker, unlike any other, rolled up preaching about a financial utopia in the Lunaverse. Intrigued, the gangsters became a crew of convinced Lunatics, united by the allure of something bigger. Tossing our old lives and IDs like yesterday's trash, we decided to roll the dice, leaving our mundane lives behind and following this visionary to embrace the grit of the unknown.

No longer bound by Earthly chains, we became pioneers, hustlers in the vastness of the Cosmos, where fortunes were made and lost with just a click. Time passed, and life seemed golden at first. But dreams, even cosmic ones, ain't bulletproof, and things started going sideways. Mo Ron, the grand orchestrator, lost his marbles, his lunatic dreams unraveling against sinister crypto foes lurking in the shadows determined to destabilize the Lunaverse.

In a showdown that echoed through the blockchain canyons, the Lunatics clashed with the Depeggors in a fierce battle for dominance. The stakes were high, and the code was their weapon. The streets were ablaze with digital gunfire as lines of code collided in a dance of encryption and decryption. Alas, despite their slick maneuvers and encrypted tactics, the Lunatics faced defeat at the hands of UST-Depeg's devious strategies. The Lunaverse crumbled like pixelated dreams, turned into a cosmic carnival of chaos. After the digital dust settled, the gangsters were left adrift, licking their virtual wounds with no home or identity, just a burning desire for redemption. Defeat slapped us hard, and though not all made it out of this battle, we ain't the quitting kind. Defeat only fueled our determination, and we swore an oath to rise again, stronger and wiser.

The streets of the blockchain were witness to their relentless hustle as they regrouped, strategized, and planned their triumphant return: the birth of the IBC Gangsters - digital renegades exploring uncharted territories / wise guys navigating the vastness of the Cosmos.

Faced with a crypto wilderness and the vast expanse of the cryptospace, the IBC Gangsters took every job available, hustling and waiting for that one opportunity to knock. Time passed, a blur of survival where every hustle and grind was a step closer to liberation. And then, like a cosmic whisper, it happened. One late night, a shiny mysterious object lit up the sky. Gathered in a dimly lit hideout, the Gangsters looked at each other, eyes reflecting determination. This, they believed, was the sign they waited for, the opening they craved to break free from the mundane and venture into the cosmic unknown. With newfound purpose, the IBC Gangsters gathered for the ultimate cosmic heist that would put them on the interstellar map – settling on an asteroid in the ROIDS solar system. A new stronghold, a cosmic base where the Gangsters suited up for adventures yet untold. No longer bound by Earthly chains, they became pioneers, hustlers in the vastness of the Cosmos, chasing the shimmering promise of a better life.

Here we are, on the edge of the universe, with a new script - a narrative where every cosmic caper in the pixelated streets echoes their resilience and hunger for a better hustle. As we cruise through the cosmos, the invitation echoes: ‘Do you have the pixelated heart to ride with the true pioneers in this cosmic game?’

For the IBC Gangsters, the journey wasn't just about code and algorithms—it was a saga of resilience, ambition, and the unyielding spirit of those who refused to be silenced by the digital echoes of defeat. Through the twists and turns of the blockchain alleyways, the IBC Gangsters never abandoned their dream to rule the Cosmos Ecosystem. With every setback, they learned, adapted, and plotted their next move. The streets were buzzing with whispers of their comeback, and the Cosmos held its breath in anticipation.
